# path-following-and-obstacle-avoidance-robot
The aim of the experiment is to make the robot move from the point (x,y) = (2,4) to the point (x,y) = (10,4). The robot has to pass through the point (x,y) = (2,10) on its way to the destination. Further, the robot has to avoid obstacles on its way as it moves through the target goals.
